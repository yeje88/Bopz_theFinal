# The Bopz App - Appsmith Repo

This repository contains the UI design for the Bopz app. The entire team contributed to this UI evenly; however, due to github challenges discussed with Dr. Fontenot, we ultimately completed the final UI on one computer and are using this repo for our second commit.

## How to Launch App:
Please follow the installation steps in the boilerplate repo first https://github.com/ellaholl/BopzApp_FlaskComponent.
Once containers are configured and runner, the app can be launched using the link at the bottom of this page.

# We hope you undertand and enjoy the app! ~ The Bopz Team

This app is built using Appsmith. Turn any datasource into an internal app in minutes. Appsmith lets you drag-and-drop components to build dashboards, write logic with JavaScript objects and connect to any API, database or GraphQL source.
